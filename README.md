## Analyzing Traffic Sources

Traffic Source Analysis
- Understanding where the customers are coming from and which channels are driving the highest quality traffic. 
- Typically, traffic sources are email, social media, search engine, and direct traffic. 
- Looking at conversion rate (CVR) which is the percentage of the traffic that converts into sales or revenue activity.

Why is it important to conduct Conversion Rate Analysis?
- Shift budget towards search engines, campaigns, or keywords driving the highest conversion rate.
- Compare user behaviour across traffic sources to customize messaging strategy.
- Identify opportunities to eliminate paid marketing channel or scale performing traffic.

### üìå What is the conversion rate of successful orders?

- ST request: We want to know which traffic source is generating website sessions and driving the orders.
- Get distinct website session ids and count the total of website sessions, orders and find the percentage of successful orders from active sessions.
- Table: utm_content | sessions (count) | orders (count) | conversion_rate

```sql
SELECT 
  utm_source, 
  utm_campaign, 
  http_referer,
  COUNT(website_session_id) AS total_sessions
FROM website_sessions
WHERE created_at < '2012-04-12'
GROUP BY 
	utm_source, 
  utm_campaign, 
  http_referer
ORDER BY total_sessions DESC;	
```

Insight: Learn more about `gsearch` `nonbrand` campaign to explore potential optimization opportunities and scale on it.

### üìå What is the conversion rate for `gsearch` `nonbrand` campaign?

We want to know from the total web sessions for `gsearch` `nonbrand` campaign, how many turned out to be successful orders and converted to sales?
- ST Request: If CVR >= 4%, then campaign is effective. Otherwise, bid down or reduce the paid marketing cost.
- Filter to sessions < 2012-04-12, utm_source = gsearch, and utm_campaign = nonbrand
- Table: sessions (count) | orders (count) | conversion rate

```sql
SELECT
  COUNT(DISTINCT wb.website_session_id) AS sessions,
  COUNT(DISTINCT o.order_id) AS orders,
  ROUND(100 * COUNT(DISTINCT o.order_id)/
    COUNT(DISTINCT wb.website_session_id),2) AS session_to_order_cvr
FROM mavenfuzzyfactory.website_sessions wb
LEFT JOIN mavenfuzzyfactory.orders o
	ON wb.website_session_id = o.website_session_id
WHERE wb.created_at < '2012-04-12'
	AND wb.utm_source = 'gsearch'
  AND wb.utm_campaign = 'nonbrand';
```

<img width="220" alt="image" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/81607668/139543484-4c50ff9c-7302-4189-897c-9760872f2811.png">

Insights: Conversion rate is less than 4%, hence overspending on gsearch nonbrand campaign. Analysis has saved company's money.

Next steps: Monitor impact of bid reduction for the campaign.

## Analyse Bid Optimization

Analysing for bid optimization is understanding the value of various segments of paid traffic to optimize marketing budget.
- Our job is to figure out the right amount of bid for various segments of traffic based on our potential revenue. 
- How do we do that?
  - Use conversion rate and revenue per click to figure out how much you should spend per click to acquire customers. 
  - Understand how website and products are performing for subsegments of traffic to optimise within channels. 
  - Analyse impact of bid changes have on ranking 

### üìå After bidding down on Apr 15, 2021, what is the trend and impact on sessions for `gsearch` `nonbrand` campaign?
- ST request: Find the weekly sessions before 2012-05-10. _I'm going a step forward and providing the conversion rate as well in anticipation that ST will ask for this information._
- Filter to < 2012-05-10, utm_source = gsearch, utm_campaign = nonbrand
- Table: week_start | session (count) | orders (count) | conversion_rate

```sql
SELECT
  MIN(DATE(wb.created_at)) AS week_start,
	COUNT(DISTINCT wb.website_session_id) AS sessions,
	COUNT(DISTINCT o.order_id) AS orders,
  ROUND(100 * COUNT(DISTINCT o.order_id)/
    COUNT(DISTINCT wb.website_session_id),2) AS conversion_rate
FROM website_sessions wb
LEFT JOIN orders o
	ON wb.website_session_id = o.website_session_id
WHERE wb.created_at < '2012-05-10'
	AND wb.utm_source = 'gsearch'
  AND wb.utm_campaign = 'nonbrand'
GROUP BY WEEK(wb.created_at);
```

Insight: The sessions and conversion rate after 2021-04-15 has dropped - the campaign is highly sensitive to bid changes. 

Next steps: Continue to monitor session volume. Want to make campaigns more efficient by maximising volume at the lowest possible bid.

### üìå What is the conversion rate from session to order by device type?
- Table: device_type | sessions (count) | orders (count) | conversion_rate

```sql
SELECT
  wb.device_type,
	COUNT(DISTINCT wb.website_session_id) AS sessions,
	COUNT(DISTINCT o.order_id) AS orders,
  ROUND(100 * COUNT(DISTINCT o.order_id)/
    COUNT(DISTINCT wb.website_session_id),2) AS conversion_rate
FROM website_sessions wb
LEFT JOIN orders o
	ON wb.website_session_id = o.website_session_id
WHERE wb.created_at < '2012-05-10'
	AND wb.utm_source = 'gsearch'
  AND wb.utm_campaign = 'nonbrand'
GROUP BY wb.device_type;
```

<img width="260" alt="image" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/81607668/139573682-d2ab9eb0-1cd7-457a-884f-bd58ccf1c738.png">

Insight: Desktop bids were driving nearly 4% session to successful orders rate, so we should reduce mobile bids and transfer the paid traffic to desktop channel instead.

### üìå After bidding up on desktop channel on 2012-05-19, what is the weekly session trend for both desktop and mobile?
- Filter to between 2012-04-15 to 2012-06-19, utm_source = gsearch, utm_campaign = nonbrand
- Table: week_start_date | desktop_sessions | mobile_sessions

```sql
SELECT
  MIN(DATE(created_at)) AS week_start_date,
  COUNT(DISTINCT CASE WHEN device_type = 'desktop' THEN website_session_id ELSE NULL END) AS desktop_sessions,
  COUNT(DISTINCT CASE WHEN device_type = 'mobile' THEN website_session_id ELSE NULL END) AS mobile_sessions
FROM website_sessions
WHERE created_at BETWEEN '2012-04-15' AND '2012-06-09'
	AND utm_source = 'gsearch'
  AND utm_campaign = 'nonbrand'
GROUP BY WEEK(created_at);
```

Insight: After biding up desktop channel on 2012-05-19, there were obvious increase in desktop volume whereas mobile volume has also dropped considerably. ST made the right decision to focus on desktop and able to optimize spend efficiently.
