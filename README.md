# Analyzing Traffic Sources

Traffic Source Analysis
- Understanding where the customers are coming from and which channels are driving the highest quality traffic. 
- Typically, traffic sources are email, social media, search engine, and direct traffic. 
- Looking at conversion rate (CVR) which is the percentage of the traffic that converts into sales or revenue activity.

Why is it important to conduct Conversion Rate Analysis?
- Shift budget towards search engines, campaigns, or keywords driving the highest conversion rate.
- Compare user behaviour across traffic sources to customize messaging strategy.
- Identify opportunities to eliminate paid marketing channel or scale performing traffic.

## What is the conversion rate of successful orders?

- ST request: We want to know which traffic source is generating website sessions and driving the orders.
- Get distinct website session ids and count the total of website sessions, orders and find the percentage of successful orders from active sessions.
- Table: utm_content | sessions (count) | orders (count) | conversion_rate

```sql
SELECT 
	utm_source, 
	utm_campaign, 
	http_referer, 
  COUNT(website_session_id) AS total_sessions
FROM website_sessions
WHERE created_at < '2012-04-12'
GROUP BY utm_source, utm_campaign, http_referer
ORDER BY total_sessions DESC;
```

Insight: Learn more about `gsearch` `nonbrand` campaign to explore potential optimization opportunities and scale on it.

## What is the conversion rate for `gsearch` `nonbrand` campaign?

We want to know from the total web sessions for `gsearch` `nonbrand` campaign, how many turned out to be successful orders and converted to sales?
- ST Request: If CVR >= 4%, then campaign is effective. Otherwise, bid down or reduce the paid marketing cost.
- Filter to sessions < 2012-04-12, utm_source = gsearch, and utm_campaign = nonbrand
- Table: sessions (count) | orders (count) | conversion rate

```sql
SELECT
  COUNT(DISTINCT wb.website_session_id) AS sessions,
  COUNT(DISTINCT o.order_id) AS orders,
  ROUND(100 * COUNT(DISTINCT o.order_id)/
    COUNT(DISTINCT wb.website_session_id),2) AS session_to_order_cvr
FROM mavenfuzzyfactory.website_sessions wb
LEFT JOIN mavenfuzzyfactory.orders o
	ON wb.website_session_id = o.website_session_id
WHERE wb.created_at < '2012-04-12'
	AND wb.utm_source = 'gsearch'
  AND wb.utm_campaign = 'nonbrand';
```

Insights: Conversion rate is less than 4%, hence overspending on gsearch nonbrand campaign. Analysis has saved company's money.

Next steps: Monitor impact of bid reduction for the campaign.
