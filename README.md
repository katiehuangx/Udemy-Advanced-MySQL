## Analyzing Traffic Sources

Traffic Source Analysis
- Understanding where the customers are coming from and which channels are driving the highest quality traffic. 
- Typically, traffic sources are email, social media, search engine, and direct traffic. 
- Looking at conversion rate (CVR) which is the percentage of the traffic that converts into sales or revenue activity.

Why is it important to conduct Conversion Rate Analysis?
- Shift budget towards search engines, campaigns, or keywords driving the highest conversion rate.
- Compare user behaviour across traffic sources to customize messaging strategy.
- Identify opportunities to eliminate paid marketing channel or scale performing traffic.

### üìå What is the conversion rate of successful orders?

- ST request: We want to know which traffic source is generating website sessions and driving the orders.
- Get distinct website session ids and count the total of website sessions, orders and find the percentage of successful orders from active sessions.
- Table: utm_content | sessions (count) | orders (count) | conversion_rate

```sql
SELECT 
  utm_source, 
  utm_campaign, 
  http_referer,
  COUNT(website_session_id) AS total_sessions
FROM website_sessions
WHERE created_at < '2012-04-12'
GROUP BY 
	utm_source, 
  utm_campaign, 
  http_referer
ORDER BY total_sessions DESC;	
```

<img width="424" alt="image" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/81607668/139542889-0aaaf833-d4fe-4013-add5-e2eb65090a27.png">

Insight: Learn more about `gsearch` `nonbrand` campaign to explore potential optimization opportunities and scale on it.

### üìå What is the conversion rate for `gsearch` `nonbrand` campaign?

We want to know from the total web sessions for `gsearch` `nonbrand` campaign, how many turned out to be successful orders and converted to sales?
- ST Request: If CVR >= 4%, then campaign is effective. Otherwise, bid down or reduce the paid marketing cost.
- Filter to sessions < 2012-04-12, utm_source = gsearch, and utm_campaign = nonbrand
- Table: sessions (count) | orders (count) | conversion rate

```sql
SELECT
  COUNT(DISTINCT wb.website_session_id) AS sessions,
  COUNT(DISTINCT o.order_id) AS orders,
  ROUND(100 * COUNT(DISTINCT o.order_id)/
    COUNT(DISTINCT wb.website_session_id),2) AS session_to_order_cvr
FROM mavenfuzzyfactory.website_sessions wb
LEFT JOIN mavenfuzzyfactory.orders o
	ON wb.website_session_id = o.website_session_id
WHERE wb.created_at < '2012-04-12'
	AND wb.utm_source = 'gsearch'
  AND wb.utm_campaign = 'nonbrand';
```

<img width="220" alt="image" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/81607668/139543484-4c50ff9c-7302-4189-897c-9760872f2811.png">

Insights: Conversion rate is less than 4%, hence overspending on gsearch nonbrand campaign. Analysis has saved company's money.

Next steps: Monitor impact of bid reduction for the campaign.

***

## Analyse Bid Optimization

Analysing for bid optimization is understanding the value of various segments of paid traffic to optimize marketing budget.
- Our job is to figure out the right amount of bid for various segments of traffic based on our potential revenue. 
- How do we do that?
  - Use conversion rate and revenue per click to figure out how much you should spend per click to acquire customers. 
  - Understand how website and products are performing for subsegments of traffic to optimise within channels. 
  - Analyse impact of bid changes have on ranking 

### üìå After bidding down on Apr 15, 2021, what is the trend and impact on sessions for `gsearch` `nonbrand` campaign?
- ST request: Find the weekly sessions before 2012-05-10. _I'm going a step forward and providing the conversion rate as well in anticipation that ST will ask for this information._
- Filter to < 2012-05-10, utm_source = gsearch, utm_campaign = nonbrand
- Table: week_start | session (count) | orders (count) | conversion_rate

```sql
SELECT
  MIN(DATE(wb.created_at)) AS week_start,
	COUNT(DISTINCT wb.website_session_id) AS sessions,
	COUNT(DISTINCT o.order_id) AS orders,
  ROUND(100 * COUNT(DISTINCT o.order_id)/
    COUNT(DISTINCT wb.website_session_id),2) AS conversion_rate
FROM website_sessions wb
LEFT JOIN orders o
	ON wb.website_session_id = o.website_session_id
WHERE wb.created_at < '2012-05-10'
	AND wb.utm_source = 'gsearch'
  AND wb.utm_campaign = 'nonbrand'
GROUP BY WEEK(wb.created_at);
```

<img width="275" alt="image" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/81607668/139573298-51e1fb02-1a8c-4746-ba67-925a2405853a.png">

Insight: The sessions and conversion rate after 2021-04-15 has dropped - the campaign is highly sensitive to bid changes. 

Next steps: Continue to monitor session volume. Want to make campaigns more efficient by maximising volume at the lowest possible bid.

### üìå What is the conversion rate from session to order by device type?
- Table: device_type | sessions (count) | orders (count) | conversion_rate

```sql
SELECT
  wb.device_type,
	COUNT(DISTINCT wb.website_session_id) AS sessions,
	COUNT(DISTINCT o.order_id) AS orders,
  ROUND(100 * COUNT(DISTINCT o.order_id)/
    COUNT(DISTINCT wb.website_session_id),2) AS conversion_rate
FROM website_sessions wb
LEFT JOIN orders o
	ON wb.website_session_id = o.website_session_id
WHERE wb.created_at < '2012-05-10'
	AND wb.utm_source = 'gsearch'
  AND wb.utm_campaign = 'nonbrand'
GROUP BY wb.device_type;
```

<img width="260" alt="image" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/81607668/139573682-d2ab9eb0-1cd7-457a-884f-bd58ccf1c738.png">

Insight: Desktop bids were driving nearly 4% session to successful orders rate, so we should reduce mobile bids and transfer the paid traffic to desktop channel instead.

### üìå After bidding up on desktop channel on 2012-05-19, what is the weekly session trend for both desktop and mobile?
- Filter to between 2012-04-15 to 2012-06-19, utm_source = gsearch, utm_campaign = nonbrand
- Table: week_start_date | desktop_sessions | mobile_sessions

```sql
SELECT
  MIN(DATE(created_at)) AS week_start_date,
  COUNT(DISTINCT CASE WHEN device_type = 'desktop' THEN website_session_id ELSE NULL END) AS desktop_sessions,
  COUNT(DISTINCT CASE WHEN device_type = 'mobile' THEN website_session_id ELSE NULL END) AS mobile_sessions
FROM website_sessions
WHERE created_at BETWEEN '2012-04-15' AND '2012-06-09'
	AND utm_source = 'gsearch'
  AND utm_campaign = 'nonbrand'
GROUP BY WEEK(created_at);
```

<img width="293" alt="image" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/81607668/139574114-532ab3a1-457b-4559-9130-6df7c237b932.png">

Insight: After biding up desktop channel on 2012-05-19, there were obvious increase in desktop volume whereas mobile volume has also dropped considerably. ST made the right decision to focus on desktop and able to optimize spend efficiently.

## Analyzing Website Performances

Website content analysis is about understanding which pages are seen most by the users and to identify where to focus on improving your business.
- Identify the most common landing page and the first thing a user sees.
- For most viewed pages and common landing pages, understand how those pages perform for business objectives.
- Does the pages tell a story or resonate with business values?

### üìå Identify most viewed website pages ranked by session volume
- Filter date < 2012-06-09
- Table: pageview_url | sessions (count)

```sql
SELECT 
  pageview_url, 
  COUNT(DISTINCT website_pageview_id) AS page_views
FROM website_pageviews
WHERE created_at < '2012-06-09'
GROUP BY pageview_url
ORDER BY page_views DESC;
```

<img width="216" alt="image" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/81607668/139636941-dfca8add-4466-454a-8d76-3c5e9139bded.png">

- Insight: Most viewed pages with highest traffic are homepage, products, and original Mr Fuzzy.
- Next steps: Is traffic for top landing pages the same?

### üìå Finding top entry/landing pages

Entry/landing page is the page where customer lands on website for the first time.
- Filter date to < 2012-06-12
- Table: landing_page_url | landing_page (count)

```sql
WITH landing_page_cte AS (
SELECT 
  website_session_id,
  MIN(website_pageview_id) AS landing_page -- Find the first page landed for each session
FROM website_pageviews
WHERE created_at < '2012-06-12'
GROUP BY website_session_id
)

SELECT 
  wp.pageview_url AS landing_page_url,
  COUNT(DISTINCT lp.website_session_id) AS count
FROM landing_page_cte lp
LEFT JOIN website_pageviews wp
  ON lp.landing_page = wp.website_pageview_id
GROUP BY wp.pageview_url
ORDER BY landing_page_url DESC;
```

<img width="153" alt="image" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/81607668/139637250-f60c1773-59e3-4708-9eae-3c9cd0b795fc.png">

- Insight: Home page is the top landing page.
- Next steps: What other metrics can we use to analyse landing page performance? How do we know the metric can appropriately judge whether a page is performing well or not?
- Possible metrics: Repeat sessions? Which day and time most viewed? By source, campaign, device type?

### üìå Analzying bounce rate for landing pages

Now that we have the sessions for the landing pages, let's find out their bounce rate.

We breakdown the steps to get a clear picture of what we're trying to find.
- Table: landing page | sessions (count) | bounced sessions (count) | bounced rate
- Step 1: Find the first `website_pageview_id` or landing page for associated session
- Step 2: Count page views for each session to identify bounces
- Step 3: Summarize total sessions and bounced sessions and calculate bounce rate

```sql
-- Step 1: Find the first `website_pageview_id` or landing page for associated session
WITH landing_page_cte AS (
SELECT 
  p.website_session_id,
  MIN(p.website_pageview_id) AS first_landing_page_id,
  p.pageview_url AS landing_page -- page view of first landing page
FROM website_pageviews p
INNER JOIN website_sessions s
  ON p.website_session_id = s.website_session_id
  AND s.created_at BETWEEN '2014-01-01' AND '2014-02-01'
GROUP BY p.website_session_id
),
-- Step 2: Count page views for each session to identify bounces
bounced_views_cte AS (
SELECT 
  lp.website_session_id,
  lp.landing_page, 
  COUNT(p.website_pageview_id) AS bounced_views
FROM landing_page_cte lp
LEFT JOIN website_pageviews p
  ON lp.website_session_id = p.website_session_id
GROUP BY 
  lp.website_session_id,
  lp.landing_page
HAVING COUNT(p.website_pageview_id) = 1
)
- Step 3: Summarize total sessions and bounced sessions and calculate bounce rate
SELECT 
  COUNT(DISTINCT lp.website_session_id) AS total_sessions, -- number of sessions by landing page
  COUNT(DISTINCT b.website_session_id) AS bounced_sessions, -- number of bounced sessions by landing page
  ROUND(100 * COUNT(DISTINCT b.website_session_id)/
    COUNT(DISTINCT lp.website_session_id),2) AS bounce_rate
FROM landing_page_cte lp -- use left join to preserve all sessions with 1 home page view
LEFT JOIN bounced_views_cte b
  ON lp.website_session_id = b.website_session_id
GROUP BY lp.landing_page;
```

<img width="315" alt="image" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/81607668/139800515-7b0938c8-c6d1-4411-b31a-b8dfecb78643.png">

Insight: `/lander-3` has highest bounce rate followed by `/lander-3` and `/home`. 

Next steps: To further investigate why `/lander-3` has > 50% bounce rate. 

### üìå Calculating bounce rate for homepage

As home page is the first page that users most commonly see on the website, ST is interested to know what's the bounce rate.

- Table: sessions | bounced sessions | bounce rate 
- Step 1: Find first website_pageview_id/landing page for associated session and filter to date < 2012-06-14 and `/home`
- Step 2: Count page views for each session to identify bounces
- Step 3: Summarize total sessions and bounced sessions

```sql
-- Step 1: Find first website_pageview_id/landing page for associated session and filter to date < 2012-06-14 and '\home'
WITH landing_page_cte AS (
SELECT 
  p.website_session_id,
  MIN(p.website_pageview_id) AS first_landing_page_id,
  p.pageview_url AS landing_page -- page view of first landing page
FROM website_pageviews p
INNER JOIN website_sessions s
  ON p.website_session_id = s.website_session_id
  AND s.created_at < '2012-06-14'
WHERE p.pageview_url = '/home' 
GROUP BY p.website_session_id
),
- Step 2: Count page views for each session to identify bounces
bounced_views_cte AS (
SELECT 
  lp.website_session_id,
  lp.landing_page, 
  COUNT(p.website_pageview_id) AS bounced_views
FROM landing_page_cte lp
LEFT JOIN website_pageviews p
  ON lp.website_session_id = p.website_session_id
GROUP BY 
  lp.website_session_id,
  lp.landing_page
HAVING COUNT(p.website_pageview_id) = 1
)
- Step 3: Summarize total sessions and bounced sessions
SELECT 
  COUNT(DISTINCT lp.website_session_id) AS total_sessions, -- number of sessions by landing page
  COUNT(DISTINCT b.website_session_id) AS bounced_sessions, -- number of bounced sessions by landing page
  ROUND(100 * COUNT(DISTINCT b.website_session_id)/
    COUNT(DISTINCT lp.website_session_id),2) AS bounce_rate
FROM landing_page_cte lp -- use left join to preserve all sessions with 1 home page view
LEFT JOIN bounced_views_cte b
  ON lp.website_session_id = b.website_session_id
GROUP BY lp.landing_page;
```

<img width="268" alt="image" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/81607668/139804071-9f7b4dc3-4bed-46e0-bc59-89b90b3b9747.png">

Insight: 60% bounce rate is pretty high especially for paid search.

### üìå Analyzing landing page tests

ST is running a A/B test on `\lander-1` and `\home` for `gsearch nonbrand` campaign and would like to find out the bounce rates for both pages.
- Criteria: Limit time period to when `\lander-1` started receiving traffic and limit results to < 2012-07-28 to ensure fair comparison.
- Table: landing_page | total sessions | bounced sessions | bounce rate
- Step 1: Find when `/lander-1` was created and first displayed to user on the website. Use either date or pageview id to limit the results.
- Step 2: Find first landing page and filter to test time period (after '2012-06-19') and as prescribed by ST (before '2012-07-28') for gsearch and nonbrand campaign.
- Step 3: Count page views for each session to identify bounces
- Step 4: Summarize total sessions and bounced sessions and calculate bounce rate

```sql
-- Step 1: Find when `/lander-1` was created and first displayed to user on the website
SELECT 
  MIN(created_at) AS lander1_created_at,
  MIN(website_pageview_id) AS lander1_website_pageview_id
FROM website_pageviews
WHERE pageview_url = '/lander-1';

-- Step 2: Find first landing page and filter to test time period '2012-06-19' to '2012-07-28' for gsearch and nonbrand campaign
WITH landing_page_cte AS (
SELECT 
  p.website_session_id,
  MIN(p.website_pageview_id) AS landing_page_id,
  p.pageview_url AS landing_page -- page view of first landing page
FROM website_pageviews p
INNER JOIN website_sessions s
  ON p.website_session_id = s.website_session_id
  AND s.created_at BETWEEN '2012-06-19' AND '2012-07-28' -- A/B test time period as prescribed
  AND utm_source = 'gsearch'
  AND utm_campaign = 'nonbrand'
  AND p.pageview_url IN ('/home','/lander-1') -- A/B test on both pages
GROUP BY p.website_session_id, p.pageview_url
),
-- Step 3: Count page views for each session to identify bounces
bounced_views_cte AS (
SELECT 
  lp.website_session_id,
  COUNT(p.website_pageview_id) AS bounced_views
FROM landing_page_cte lp
LEFT JOIN website_pageviews p
  ON lp.website_session_id = p.website_session_id -- join where session id with first landing page
GROUP BY lp.website_session_id
HAVING COUNT(p.website_pageview_id) = 1 -- Filter for page views = 1 view = bounced view
)
-- Step 4: Summarize total sessions and bounced sessions and calculate bounce rate
SELECT 
  landing_page,
  COUNT(DISTINCT lp.website_session_id) AS total_sessions, -- number of sessions by landing page
  COUNT(DISTINCT b.website_session_id) AS bounced_sessions, -- number of bounced sessions by landing page
  ROUND(100 * COUNT(DISTINCT b.website_session_id)/
    COUNT(DISTINCT lp.website_session_id),2) AS bounce_rate
FROM landing_page_cte lp -- use left join to preserve all sessions with 1 page view
LEFT JOIN bounced_views_cte b
  ON lp.website_session_id = b.website_session_id
GROUP BY lp.landing_page;
```

<img width="343" alt="image" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/81607668/139808742-1f307189-6633-4765-baf2-57969405f8cd.png">

Insight: Looks like the newly created `/lander-1`'s traffic has improved and bounce rate has reduced too, meaning fewer customers has bounced on the page.  

Next steps: Ensure that all new campaigns are directed to the new lander-1 page and monitor the bounce rates.
